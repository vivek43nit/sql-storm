<!--    Attribute Info:
    //labeling and grouping same dbs for different environment
        ID -> just for differentiate between different connections; not in use as of now; but provide unique id for unique connections
        GROUP ->  mention any group that you want like : production, stage, local etc.
        DB_NAME -> name the db you want to connect. This value will be used just to show the labels in the ui. Can be different name than actual db name
    
    //Connection Settings
        USER_NAME -> user name to be used for connection
        PASSWORD -> password to be used for connection
        DRIVER_CLASS_NAME -> driver name
        DATABASE_URL ->  actual url to be used for connection. It should always point to db also, connection without db-name will use value of DB_NAME as db
    
    //Access control(these options are not recommended for the prod environment, untill you secure the logins with session )
        UPDATABLE   -> if this attribute will present you will get add and edit option with table view
        DELETABLE   -> if this attribute will present you will get delete option for rows in the view-->
